This Projects involves creating a real-time ticketing system using Java, Spring Boot, and 
multithreading. The system simulates customers purchasing tickets and vendors releasing them 
concurrently, with proper synchronization to avoid issues like race conditions. Both customers 
and vendors operate as separate threads, dynamically adjusting ticket retrieval and release rates. 
The project also includes command-line interaction, allowing users to start and stop the system 
while setting key parameters such as ticket capacity. Additionally, ticket details are saved in JSON 
format to ensure data persistence, showcasing practical skills in concurrency and server-side 
development.
